pdCluster: Partial Discharges Clustering

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_discharge][Partial discharge]] measurements analysis may determine the existence of
defects. This package provides several tools for feature generation,
exploratory graphical analysis, clustering and variable importance
quantification for partial discharge signals.

The development pages of =pdCluster= are [[https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id%3D1101][here]].

Along this webpage you will find some examples using some real
datasets.

* The Prony's method

A clean partial discharge signal can be regarded as a finite combination of
damped complex exponentials. Under this assumption, the so-called
Prony's method allows for the estimation of frequency, amplitude,
phase and damping components of the signal.

We have a collection of signals in a =list= named =signalList=
([[file:signalList.RData][download]]). 

#+begin_src r
load('signalList.RData')
#+end_src

The signals contain zeros at the beginning and at the
end. The =no0= function can remove these parts.
  
#+begin_src r
xyplot(signalList, y.same=NA, FUN=function(x){xyplot(ts(no0(x)))})
#+end_src

With these cleaned signals the Prony's method can provide their
components. 
  
#+begin_src r
signal <- signalList[[3]]
pr <- prony(signal, M=10)
xyplot(pr)
#+end_src 

Since the number of components must be fixed \a priori\,
the function =compProny= allows the comparison of different numbers:
  
#+begin_src r
compProny(signal, M=c(10, 20, 30, 40))
#+end_src

* Feature generation

=pdCluster= includes several functions for feature
generation. The =analysis= function comprises all of them. The
results for our example signal are:

#+begin_src r
analysis(signal)
#+end_src 

This function can be used with a list of signals in order to obtain a
matrix of features:
#+begin_src r
analysisList <- lapply(signalList[1:10], analysis)
pdData <- do.call(rbind, analysisList)
#+end_src 

Now we need the angle and reflection information, available from
another different dataset (named =pdSummary=, [[file:pdSummary.RData][download]]). 

#+begin_src r
load('pdSummary.RData')
#+end_src

In order to safely share the information, both
data frames must be reordered by their energy values: 

#+begin_src r 
idxOrderSummary=order(pdSummary$sumaCuadrados)
idxOrderData=order(pdData$energy)

pdDataOrdered=cbind(pdData[idxOrderData,], 
pdSummary[idxOrderSummary,c('angulo', 'separacionOriginal')])
#+end_src 

Later, the data frame to be used with the clustering algorithm has to
ordered by time. Thus the samples of the =clara= method will
be random.

#+begin_src r
idx <- do.call(order, pdSummary[idxOrderSummary, c('segundo', 'inicio')])
pdDataOrdered <- pdDataOrdered[idx,]
#+end_src 

We can now construct a =PD= object. (The
  =pdCluster= package is designed with S4 classes and
  methods. Two classes have been defined: =PD= and =PDCluster=).

#+begin_src r
pd <- df2PD(pdDataOrdered)
#+end_src 

The results of =analysis= to the whole dataset are available [[file:dfHibr.RData][here]].

#+begin_src r
load('dfHibr.RData')

dfHibr <- df2PD(dfHibr)
#+end_src

* Transformations

Prior to the clustering algorithm, the feature matrix has to be
filtered:

#+begin_src r
dfFilter <- filterPD(dfHibr)
#+end_src 

and transformed:

#+begin_src r
dfTrans <- transformPD(dfFilter)
#+end_src 

The next figure compares the datasets after and before
of the transformations:

#+begin_src r
nZCbefore <- as.data.frame(dfFilter)$nZC
nZCafter <- as.data.frame(dfTrans)$nZC
comp <- data.frame(After=nZCafter, Before=nZCbefore)
#+end_src 

#+begin_src r
h <- histogram(~After+Before, data=comp,
          scales=list(x=list(relation='free'),
            y=list(relation='free',
              draw=FALSE)),
          breaks=100, col='gray',
          xlab='',
          strip.names=c(TRUE, TRUE), bg='gray', fg='darkblue')

#+end_src   

#+ATTR_HTML: width="480"

The =filterPD= method is a wrapper for the general
=subset= method. With =subset= it is possible to extract
a group of samples based on a condition and select only certain
columns. 

#+begin_src r
dfTransSubset <- subset(dfTrans, 
                        subset=(angle >= 90 & angle <=180), 
                        select=c(energy, W1, nZC))

dfTransSubset
#+end_src 


* Graphical tools

The =pdCluster= packages includes a set of graphical exploratory
tools, such as a scatterplot matrices with hexagonal binning, density
plots histograms or phase resolved partial discharge patterns, both
with partial transparency or hexagonal binning.

#+begin_src r
splom(dfTrans)
#+end_src  

#+ATTR_HTML: width="480"
[[file:splomPD.png]]

#+begin_src r
densityplot(dfTrans)
#+end_src
  
#+begin_src r
histogram(dfTrans)
#+end_src
  
#+begin_src r
xyplot(dfTrans)
#+end_src  
  
#+begin_src r
hexbinplot(dfTrans)
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: width="480"
[[file:hexbinPD.png]]

* Clustering

The filtered and transformed object can now be used with the
clustering algorithm. The results are displayed with a phase resolved
pattern with clusters in separate panels in the . The colors encode
the distance of each point to the /medoid/ of its cluster. The
displays the same pattern with superposed clusters. Here the colors
encode the membership to a certain cluster, and transparency is used
to denote density of points in a region.

The results can be easily understood with the density plots of each
cluster and feature or with the histograms .

#+begin_src r
dfTransCluster <- claraPD(dfTrans, noise.level=0.7, noise.rm=TRUE)
#+end_src 
  
#+begin_src r
xyplot(dfTransCluster)
#+end_src  

  
#+begin_src r
xyplot(dfTransCluster, panelClust=FALSE)
#+end_src  

#+ATTR_HTML: width="480"
[[file:clusterScatterPlot.png]]

#+begin_src r
histogram(dfTransCluster)
#+end_src

#+begin_src r
densityplot(dfTransCluster)
#+end_src
